correctly. This is what Kevin found and fixed.
- Fileman files automatically installed without any questions being asked when
you run VPE via ^XV.
- Relicensing code to Apache 2.0.

### MUMPS V1 Support

This release adds a new supported M implementation to VPE, that of Mumps V1.
Mumps V1 must compiled from source with the SAMTERM define set to 1. You will
need to edit the mumps.h to do that (search for SAMTERM). This changes Read
terminator behavior in MV1 to be consistent with what VistA expects.

### Bug Fixes (and minor enhancements)

#### Editor
- Routine names > 8 chars print fully on top of buffer
- ESC-R now hows to how handle long tags and long routines names (> 8 char)
- ESC-R now can jump to labels, not just [label]^routine.
- Don't warn if a routine contains a long label (> 8 chars)
- ..VRR QWIK can now take a tag of the shell like ..E (e.g. `..VRR XUSRB CVC`).
- ESC-G now displays globals from the editor. This is not exactly new functionality, but apparently it hasn't worked for a while now.
- Routine editing lock was not removed after routines were edited for the first level of routine editing.

#### Other
- VPE error trap now tells you where the error happened using $ST(-1).
- New routine creator should not have an 8 char limit for routine name.
- ..LOCKTAB QWIK implementation for GT.M
- ..DOS QWIK (zsystem) implementation for GT.M


## Changes for version 13.2
 
 * Routine editor will clear $EC when it starts. Previously, having an active
   error aborted the save, potentially leading you to lose the changes you made.
 * Now can have up to 1024 routine buffers open. Previously, the limit was 4.
 * V13.0 introduced a bug where VPE does not remember your previous routine
   name. This was due to a check on a global that was removed. This check
   itself was removed and now VPE remembers the last routine you were editing.
 * At the first column, you can now insert a space in addition to a tab. A
   space in the first column will behave the same as the tab, advancing the
   cursor to the line body from the label line. Previously, only a tab was
   allowed. A pleasant side effect of this is that correctly formatted M code can
   be directly pasted into VPE.
 * ZR QWIK (ZREMOVE) now deletes routines on GT.M. Previously, it only worked
   on DSM variants.
 * Two changes for Routine Search:
 ** Routine Search was prevented from running if you were 2 levels down in the
    routine editor. This restriction has been removed.
 ** RSEARCH QWIK invokes VPE's native (and superior!) routine search rather
    than the one provided by the M implementation.
 * E QWIK or VRR QWIK (Edit/Read Routine) when invoked with invalid routine
   names (such as a routine called "&") when into an infinite loop and
   overflowed the stack. This has been fixed. This has nothing to do with 13.1's
   error code fixes; rather it's a GOTO gone wild in the original VPE code.
 * Standalone VPE now just asks for User ID only. Previously, it asked for your
   DUZ as well, which didn't make any sense in a non-VISTA context.

## Changes for version 13.1

 * Automargin outside of screen operations is fixed
 * Unused routines removed (old editor and timeout screensaver routine)
 * All error traps are M95 standard and use VPE code to teardown data structures
 * Routine search (RS from Editor) now works on GT.M, not just DSM variants (used to rely on ZLOAD).
 * QWIK arguments should not be uppercased (e.g. '..e test' edited the routine TEST, which is not appropriate)

## Changes for VPE from 12.0 to 13.0
NB: Authors are noted as Sam Habiel (SMH) and David Wicksell (DLW).

 * VPE has been renamedspaced from VEE, ZVE, and %ZVE to XVV and ZVE (Most done
   by DLW; SMH did the % Routines renamespacing; SMH refactored all of the code
   embedded in the %ZVEMS Globals into routines starting with XVS. All 
   renamespacing done via rename, mv, and sed Unix Commands.)
 * New system QWIK: ZINSERT called via ..ZI. Allows you to paste an entire
   routine in. (Author: DLW for GT.M; Cache Support and bug fixes: SMH).
 * Remove install question about Manager UCI. This is installed in a user namespace now. (SMH).
 * Remove warnings about Global Protection. This is installed in a user namespace now. (SMH).
 * Cache is listed as a supported system when installing (SMH).
 * Automatic installation of VPE if it is not already installed (SMH).
 * Main Error Trap for VPE is now fixed permanently to prevent crashes (SMH).
 * Like MSC Fileman, ask for DUZ or User Name rather than Access Code on first
   start if VISTA is installed (SMH).
 * Automargin code for Cache and GT.M. Any full screen editor or viewer will
   automatically take up your whole terminal screen. You are no longer limited
   to 80 x 24. Previously, you could change that using your parameters. Now,
   it is automatically resized for you (SMH). Automargin code was redone by SMH 
   from work by George Timson in a %ZIS3 posted on the Hardhats Google Group.
 * GT.M Save Routines is very robust now and should never fail; however, it
   will always save to the first directory in $ZROUTINES even if the routine was
   loaded from another directory; unlike the native "ZED" editor behavior. This
   still needs to be fixed. Code taken from Kernel-GTM project. (SMH).
 * Routine name size is unlimited (SMH; with help from Lloyd Milligan from his
   website); previously, it was limited to 8 characters.
 * XINDEX invocation from Routine editor is now fixed (SMH).
 * VGL was blocked from Routine editor if user doesn't have DUZ(0)="@", even
   though VGL can be invoked independently by the same user. This block was
   removed (SMH).

## Version 12.5  2009/12/09 00:57:41  vpe (FWS/DLW)

Added a new entry point to VPE, via calling a 
routine from a shell (mumps -r XV), or in GT.M
Direct Mode (D ^XV). Also sets up environment.
Sam Habiel donated the following 11 routines,
which comprise the code found in ^%XVEMS.
XV.m, XV.m, XVRCE.m, XVRSE.m, XVSA.m, XVSC.m,
XVSK.m, XVSO.m, XVSQ.m, XVSR.m, XVSS.m, XVST.m

Added a new system QWIK, called ZInsert. Called
as ..ZI from VSHELL. It simulates some of the 
functionality of ZInsert in Cach√©, allowing
programmers to copy a routine from their development
environment and paste it into VPE in the shared
environment elsewhere. It does not, however, allow
you to have the full functionality of a routine 
buffer, yet.

Fixed multiple bugs in VPE code...

## Version 12.4  2009/11/13 18:13:08  vpe (FWS/DLW)
changed namespace
The great namespace shuffle.

as per SAC, renamespacing VPE from VEE*, 
ZVE*, and %ZVE* to XVV*, XVE*, and %XVE*. There 
were no conflicts. They were done for routine
names, and contents of all routines, and
globals. I ran a script I wrote called
convert2XV.sh, which will be here for this 
revision only. It is a one time process.
I had to reinstall VPE, by running ^XVEMBLD
and then for Fileman, ^XVVMINIT. 

## Version 12.3  2009/08/25 22:04:31  vpe checkpoint (FWS/DLW)

NB: ven/smh - removed!! VPE shouldn't change fileman code.
fws/dlw:
added a global set for ^DD("OS",19,"ZS") and
changed ^%ZVEMS to include Rick's error code

## Version 12.2  2009/08/21 22:43:23  vpe (FWS/DLW)
fws/dlw:
remove dead lines and add save in first piece
Note: The $ZRO in the ci message was replaced
      with nothing. The first $ZRO piece is
	  used by ZSAVE^%ZVEMKY3 as the target.

### Routine Editor
#### Versioning 
The Library module has been enhanced to include versioning. When you edit a routine and save your changes, you will be prompted to create a version of the routine. You can create a new version or update an existing version. The version is stored in the VPE Version file and can be restored at anytime via the ..LBRY menu. Read the Help option in system QWIK ..LBRY for more information.
#### Saving Code To The Clipboard
The editor's Cut/Copy/Paste functions have been enhanced to allow you to copy a portion of a line of code to the clipboard and paste it back in at a different location.

Hit \<F3\> to put the editor into Block mode. Hit \<AU\> or \<AD\> to highlight lines of code, and \<AL\> or \<AR\> to highlight characters of code. When highlighting characters of code, you may only highlight characters from a single line, excluding the line tag.

\<ESC V\> will paste the code to the new location of the cursor, but it will do it differently depending on whether the clipboard has lines or characters of code. If you're pasting lines, the new lines will be inserted below the line the cursor is currently on. If you're pasting characters, the characters will be inserted into the current line at the point where the cursor is located. If you are in Block mode and have highlighted some code, \<ESC V\> will replace that code with the contents of the clipboard.

While in Block mode, hit \<HOME\> to highlight lines from the cursor to the top of the routine, and \<END\> to highlight lines from the cursor to the bottom of the routine.

Here is a summary of keys used to Cut/Copy/Paste:

| Shortcut Key  | Action                                                          |        
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \<F3\>        | Turn Block mode on & off.|
| \<AU\> \<AD\> | Highlight lines of code.|
| \<AL\> \<AR\> | Highlight characters of code.|
| \<DEL\>       | When Block mode is on, delete highlighted lines/characters.|
| \<ESC C\>     | Copy highlighted code to the clipboard.|
| \<ESC D\>     | Block mode off - Delete current line.|
|               | Block mode on - Delete highlighted lines/characters.|
| \<ESC X\>     | Cut highlighted code to the clipboard.|
| \<ESC V\>     | Paste code from the clipboard into the routine.|
|               | 0 Lines will be inserted below the current line.|
|               | 0 Characters will be inserted into the current line.|
|               | If you are in Block mode when you hit \<ESC V\>, highlighted|
|               | code will be replaced by the contents of the clipboard.|
| \<HOME\>      | Highlight from the cursor to the top of the routine.|
| \<END\>       | Highlight from the cursor to the bottom of the routine.|

#### Find Tag
The Find Tag option on the editor¬ís menu bar has been enhanced. It now lists all line tags in the routine and allows you to select a tag and move to it. While in the editor, hit <TAB> to go to the menu bar and then type F for Find Tag.

#### NoDt
 In previous versions of VPE, you could set the variable VEENODT =1 to tell the editor not to update the date on the top line of the routine when you saved your changes. This allowed you to make temporary changes to a routine for testing purposes and then remove the changes and restore the routine back to exactly the way it was before. However, you did have to remember to set VEENODT and also to KILL the variable when your editing was done. Using this variable is no longer necessary. Now, when you exit an editing session, you are prompted with:

```
   QUIT  SAVE  SAVE_AS  SAVE_NODT
```

Choose SAVE\_NODT to save your changes without updating the date on the top line.

#### Routine Search
To reach the Routine Search module, hit \<TAB\> to move to the menu bar and then type RS. This module allows you to list all routines edited on, before, or after a certain date by entering the search criteria in the following syntax:
```
                  <10/12/00        Find all routines edited before Dec 10, 2000.
                  >10/12/00        Find all routines edited after Dec 10, 2000.
                  =10/12/00        Find all routines edited on Dec 10, 2000.
```
This functionality stopped working when the year became 00. It has been fixed and now supports the year 2000.

#### Inserting a New Line of Code
To insert a new line of code in the editor, hit \<RET\> to open a blank line. It doesn't matter where your cursor is positioned when you hit \<RET\>, it will always open a blank line just below the line your cursor is on.

Once you've opened a blank line you either hit \<TAB\> and start entering your code, or type a line tag and then hit \<TAB\>. If you hit \<RET\> again before you enter any code (or \<BS\>), the blank line will close. From the time you hit \<RET\> to open a blank line, and the time you hit \<TAB\>, the editor is in a special mode where it is trying to determine whether you've entered a valid line tag. This special mode has been changed slightly.

If you entered some code and then hit \<RET\> before hitting \<TAB\>, you used to get a message saying that a line tag must be followed by a \<TAB\>, and it would keep you right there. This has been changed. If you enter some text on a blank line and then hit \<RET\>, the editor goes ahead and puts the \<TAB\> there for you and then continues on as if you had entered the \<TAB\>. Like before, it then checks the tag to make sure it is valid.

### VEDD (Electronic Data Dictionary)
#### Keys & Indexes
In VEDD's main menu, the Cross References option has been changed to Keys & Indexes. It now includes sections for Keys, New-style Indexes, and Old-style Indexes. Keys and new-style indexes were introduced in Fileman version 22.
#### Individual Field Summary
Information on Keys and New-style Indexes has been added to the Individual Field Summary display. In addition, text now displays with a more natural appearance, making fields such as the DESCRIPTION field easier to read.

### VPE (Programmer Shell)
Fixed a bug in System QWIK ..KEYS.

Added routine VEEMVPE, which allows you to edit the VPE PERSON file with a Screenman form.

## Changes for VPE from 9.0 to 10.0
Author: Dave Bolduc

 * Selector: Embellished. If you don't know what the Selector is, you can ignore this or become so curious you are forced to seek it out.
 * Editor Changes: 
     * Type \<esc\>= to add a line of '=' characters as a text separator.  The same behavior is true for \<esc\>\_ and \<esc\>-.
     * The format of the date affixed to the top line of a routine has changed.
     * Using the RS command now lets you type >6/5/99 to find all routines edited after 6/5/99 (this makes it work with the new date style).
 * Bug fixes: misc fixes.
 * Editor and Routine Reader: If you use <esc>R to jump to a routine referenced in the code, it will load the referenced routine and move to the line label in the reference.  For instance, presume D TEST^XYZRTN is contained in the routine on the screen.  Placing the cursor on the ^ and pressing <esc> then R will load up the XYZRTN and start the display at line TEST.
 * Routine Lister: Type ..RL and select some routines. It lists them in a single column list format, or a block format using 8 columns across. You can also enter a number (for example 2) and it will display in list format the number of lines you entered. If you entered 2, it would display the 1st and 2nd lines of each routine selected.
