Revision 12.5  2009/12/09 00:57:41  vpe
Checkpoint

Added a new entry point to VPE, via calling a 
routine from a shell (mumps -r XV), or in GT.M
Direct Mode (D ^XV). Also sets up environment.
Sam Habiel donated the following 11 routines,
which comprise the code found in ^%XVEMS.
XV.m, XV.m, XVRCE.m, XVRSE.m, XVSA.m, XVSC.m,
XVSK.m, XVSO.m, XVSQ.m, XVSR.m, XVSS.m, XVST.m

Added a new system QWIK, called ZInsert. Called
as ..ZI from VSHELL. It simulates some of the 
functionality of ZInsert in Cach√©, allowing
programmers to copy a routine from their development
environment and paste it into VPE in the shared
environment elsewhere. It does not, however, allow
you to have the full functionality of a routine 
buffer, yet.

Fixed multiple bugs in VPE code...

Revision 12.4  2009/11/13 18:13:08  vpe
changed namespace
The great namespace shuffle.

as per SAC, renamespacing VPE from VEE*, 
ZVE*, and %ZVE* to XVV*, XVE*, and %XVE*. There 
were no conflicts. They were done for routine
names, and contents of all routines, and
globals. I ran a script I wrote called
convert2XV.sh, which will be here for this 
revision only. It is a one time process.
I had to reinstall VPE, by running ^XVEMBLD
and then for Fileman, ^XVVMINIT. 

Revision 12.3  2009/08/25 22:04:31  vpe
checkpoint

added a global set for ^DD("OS",19,"ZS") and
changed ^%ZVEMS to include Rick's error code

Revision 12.2  2009/08/21 22:43:23  vpe
remove dead lines and add save in first piece
Note: The $ZRO in the ci message was replaced
      with nothing. The first $ZRO piece is
	  used by ZSAVE^%ZVEMKY3 as the target.
